# InstaTube - Social Media Platform on Replit

## Overview
InstaTube is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) social media platform inspired by Instagram. It features real-time messaging, posts, stories, notifications, and more.

**Current State:** Fully configured and running on Replit with all features operational.

## Project Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React 18 + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas
- **Real-time:** Socket.io
- **File Storage:** Cloudinary (images/videos)
- **Authentication:** JWT + bcrypt

### Port Configuration
- **Frontend (Vite):** Port 5000 (public-facing)
- **Backend (Express):** Port 3000 (internal)
- Frontend proxies API requests to backend at `localhost:3000`

### Workflows
1. **backend** - Runs backend server on port 3000
   - Command: `cd backend && npm start`
   - Serves API endpoints and Socket.io connections
   
2. **frontend** - Runs Vite dev server on port 5000
   - Command: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
   - Public-facing web application

### Socket.io Events
Real-time events configured in `backend/socket/socket.js`:

## Troubleshooting

### If the app isn't loading
1. Check both workflows are running (backend + frontend)
2. Verify environment secrets are set
3. Check MongoDB Atlas connection (IP whitelist)
4. Review workflow logs for errors

### Common Issues
- **Port conflicts:** Backend uses 3000, frontend uses 5000
