# InstaTube - Social Media Platform on Replit

## Overview
InstaTube is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) social media platform inspired by Instagram. It features real-time messaging, posts, stories, notifications, and more.

**Current State:** Fully configured and running on Replit with all features operational.

## Project Architecture

### Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas
- **Real-time:** Socket.io

### Port Configuration
- **Frontend (Vite):** Port 5000 (public-facing)
