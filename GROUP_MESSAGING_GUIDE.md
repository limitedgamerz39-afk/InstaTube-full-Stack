## 🔧 Technical Details

### Backend Models:

**Group Model:**
- name, description, avatar
- admin (user who created)
- members (array with role: admin/member)
- lastMessage, lastMessageAt

**GroupMessage Model:**
- group, sender, text
- readBy (array of users who read)
- timestamps

### API Endpoints:

```
POST   /api/groups                      - Create group
GET    /api/groups                      - Get user's groups
GET    /api/groups/:groupId             - Get group info
POST   /api/groups/:groupId/messages    - Send message
GET    /api/groups/:groupId/messages    - Get messages
POST   /api/groups/:groupId/members     - Add member (admin only)
DELETE /api/groups/:groupId/leave       - Leave group
```

### Socket Events:

**Emitted:**
- `newGroup` - When group is created
- `newGroupMessage` - When message is sent
- `addedToGroup` - When user is added to group
- `groupMemberAdded` - When new member joins
- `memberLeftGroup` - When member leaves

---

## 🎨 UI Components

### Groups Page (`/groups`):
- List of all user's groups
- Create group button
- Group creation modal
- Member search

### GroupChat Page (`/group/:groupId`):
- Group header with member avatars
- Real-time message list

## 🔄 How It Works

### Message Flow:

1. **User types message** → Frontend captures input
2. **Optimistic Update** → Message appears instantly (temp ID)
3. **API Call** → POST to `/api/groups/:groupId/messages`
4. **Backend saves** → MongoDB stores message
5. **Socket.io broadcasts** → All members receive via `newGroupMessage` event
6. **Frontend updates** → Replace temp message with real message
7. **All users see** → Real-time sync across devices

### Group Creation Flow:

1. User fills form → name, members
2. POST to `/api/groups`
3. Backend creates group
4. Socket.io notifies all members
5. Members receive `newGroup` event
6. Group appears in their list
